```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Setup

Testing data-mining and data-analysis with R. Extraction of MLB baseball statistics from <http://www.baseball-reference.com> and later on computing advanced stats and metrics.


```{r auto-run block}
setwd("D:/Users/YCHEN/Desktop/RWorkspace/MLB Sandbox")
library(XML)                            # 3.98-1.4
library(plyr)                           # 1.8.4
library(dplyr,verbose = FALSE)           # 0.5.0
library(stringr)                        # 1.1.0
library(tidyverse,verbose = TRUE)       # 1.0.0,uploads:ggplot2,dplyr,tidyr,readr,purrr,tibble
library(ggthemes)                       # 3.2.0
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
